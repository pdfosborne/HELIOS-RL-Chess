# HELIOS-RL-Chess

Application of the HELIOS-RL architecture to Chess. 

Uniquely, this defines Chess as a Text Game and compares to human annotated language of board configurations sourced from public forum discussions on pro level matches. 

To simplify the game for faster testing, a sub-goal is used defined by the first capture. The game will therefore end when either player captures a piece.
